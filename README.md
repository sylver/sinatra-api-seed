# sinatra-api-seed â€” the seed for Sinatra API apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical Sinatra API app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your sinatra webapp projects and dev environment for these projects.

The seed contains a sample sinatra application and is bundle with all needed configuration to instantiate a preconfigured vagrant machine.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to start with all needed tools and some examples.

## Stack

This template uses :

- Sinatra as the main application
- Sequel as the ORM
- PostgreSQL as the database (no sqlite for development, it's better to have all the stack already there when developing, thanks to vagrant)
- MiniTest for the unit testing
- More to come soon

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the sinatra-api-seed repository and configure your environment to start the vagrant machine :

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the sinatra-api-seed repository. You can get it from

### Clone sinatra-api-seed

Clone the sinatra-api-seed repository using git :
```
git clone https://github.com/rksylvr/sinatra-api-seed.git

## About Vagrant

Copy the `./devkit/Vagrantfile` to your project root path then
replace the line `config.vm.box = "wheezy_min"` with whatever box you need.

To install a box, simply run `vagrant box add [boxname]`  
You can find boxes on [Vagrant Cloud][vagrantcloud]
